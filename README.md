BindCraft is an open-source, automated pipeline for <em>de novo</em> protein binder design, achieving experimental success rates of 10-100%. Using deep learning models like AlphaFold2, BindCraft generates high-affinity binders without the need for high-throughput screening or prior knowledge of binding sites. It has been successfully applied to challenging targets, including cell-surface receptors, allergens, and CRISPR-Cas9. In one example, the binders reduced IgE binding to birch allergens in patient samples, showcasing its potential in therapeutics, diagnostics, and biotechnology.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Despite the exciting progress in target-specific de novo protein binder design, peptide binder design remains challenging due to the flexibility of peptide structures and the scarcity of protein-peptide complex structure data. In this study, we curated a large synthetic data set, referred to as PepPC-F, from the abundant protein−protein interface data and developed DiffPepBuilder, a de novo target-specific peptide binder generation method that utilizes an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model trained on PepPC-F to codesign peptide sequences and structures. DiffPepBuilder also introduces disulfide bonds to stabilize the generated peptide structures. We tested DiffPepBuilder on 30 experimentally verified strong peptide binders with available protein−peptide complex structures. DiffPepBuilder was able to effectively recall the native structures and sequences of the peptide ligands and to generate novel peptide binders with improved binding free energy. We subsequently conducted de novo generation case studies on three targets. In both the regeneration test and case studies, DiffPepBuilder outperformed AfDesign and RFdiffusion coupled with ProteinMPNN, in terms of sequence and structure recall, interface quality, and structural diversity. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the introduction of disulfide bonds enhanced the structural rigidity and binding performance of the generated peptides. As a general peptide binder de novo design tool, DiffPepBuilder can be used to design peptide binders for given protein targets with three-dimensional and binding site information.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
General approaches for designing sequence-specific peptide-binding proteins would have wide utility in proteomics and synthetic biology. However, designing peptide-binding proteins is challenging, as most peptides do not have defined structures in isolation, and hydrogen bonds must be made to the buried polar groups in the peptide backbone1–3. Here, inspired by natural and re-engineered proteinpeptide systems4–11, we set out to design proteins made out of repeating units that bind peptides with repeating sequences, with a one-to-one correspondence between the repeat units of the protein and those of the peptide. We use geometric hashing to identify protein backbones and peptide-docking arrangements that are compatible with bidentate hydrogen bonds between the side chains of the protein and the peptide backbone12. The remainder of the protein sequence is then optimized for folding and peptide binding. We design repeat proteins to bind to six different tripeptide-repeat sequences in polyproline II conformations. The proteins are hyperstable and bind to four to six tandem repeats of their tripeptide targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities in vitro and in living cells. Crystal structures reveal repeating interactions between protein and peptide interactions as designed, including ladders of hydrogen bonds from protein side chains to peptide backbones. By redesigning the binding interfaces of individual repeat units, specificity can be achieved for non-repeating peptide sequences and for disordered regions of native proteins.

针对难以成药的蛋白质设计结合剂是药物开发中的难题，尤其是无序或构象不稳定的蛋白。我们提出了一种通用算法框架，利用目标蛋白的氨基酸序列设计短链线性多肽。通过对ESM-2蛋白语言模型的潜在空间进行高斯扰动生成多肽候选序列，并通过基于CLIP的对比学习架构筛选靶向选择性。最终创建了Peptide Prioritization via CLIP（PepPrCLIP）管道，并在实验中验证了这些多肽的有效性，既可作为抑制剂，也可通过与E3泛素连接酶融合降解多种蛋白靶标。该策略无需稳定的三级结构，能够靶向无序和难以成药的蛋白质，如转录因子和融合致癌蛋白。

In this study, we curated a large synthetic data set, referred to as PepPC-F, from the abundant protein−protein interface data and developed DiffPepBuilder, a de novo target-specific peptide binder generation method that utilizes an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model trained on PepPC-F to codesign peptide sequences and structures. DiffPepBuilder also introduces disulfide bonds to stabilize the generated peptide structures. We tested DiffPepBuilder on 30 experimentally verified strong peptide binders with available protein−peptide complex structures. DiffPepBuilder was able to effectively recall the native structures and sequences of the peptide ligands and to generate novel peptide binders with improved binding free energy. We subsequently conducted de novo generation case studies on three targets. In both the regeneration test and case studies, DiffPepBuilder outperformed AfDesign and RFdiffusion coupled with ProteinMPNN, in terms of sequence and structure recall, interface quality, and structural diversity. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the introduction of disulfide bonds enhanced the structural rigidity and binding performance of the generated peptides. As a general peptide binder de novo design tool, DiffPepBuilder can be used to design peptide binders for given protein targets with three-dimensional and binding site information.",,true,Diffusion/Luhua Lai/ColabDesign/ProteinMPNN/MD

However, designing peptide-binding proteins is challenging, as most peptides do not have defined structures in isolation, and hydrogen bonds must be made to the buried polar groups in the peptide backbone1–3. Here, inspired by natural and re-engineered proteinpeptide systems4–11, we set out to design proteins made out of repeating units that bind peptides with repeating sequences, with a one-to-one correspondence between the repeat units of the protein and those of the peptide. We use geometric hashing to identify protein backbones and peptide-docking arrangements that are compatible with bidentate hydrogen bonds between the side chains of the protein and the peptide backbone12. The remainder of the protein sequence is then optimized for folding and peptide binding. We design repeat proteins to bind to six different tripeptide-repeat sequences in polyproline II conformations. The proteins are hyperstable and bind to four to six tandem repeats of their tripeptide targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities in vitro and in living cells. Crystal structures reveal repeating interactions between protein and peptide interactions as designed, including ladders of hydrogen bonds from protein side chains to peptide backbones. By redesigning the binding interfaces of individual repeat units, specificity can be achieved for non-repeating peptide sequences and for disordered regions of native proteins.",,true,David Baker
